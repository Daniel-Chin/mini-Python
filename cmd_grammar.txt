Remarks:
  Dump the concept of "slot". 
    A slot can contain expressions:
      a[3].b[1] = 5
      (a, b) = 3, 4
    A slot is always an expression. 
    So, why not disregard the difference at parse time, and deal with it at run time? 

The sequence I remember them:
  expression
  expression Assign expression
  Pass
  If expression:
  Elif expression:
  Else:
  While expression:
  Break
  Def Identifier(Identifier...):
  Return
  Class Identifier(expression):
  Continue
  Del expression
  Try:
  Except expression:
  Finally:
  Import Identifier...
  Raise expression
  For expression In expression:

Classifying:
  needs indent:
    If expression:
    Elif expression:
    While expression:
    Except expression:
    For expression In expression:
    Else:
    Try:
    Finally:
    Def Identifier(Identifier...):
    Class Identifier(expression):
  elif starting with Keywords:
    Import Identifier
    Del expression
    Raise expression
    Pass
    Break
    Return
    Continue
  else:
    expression
    expression Assign expression
